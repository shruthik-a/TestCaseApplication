This is my Test Case Management Tool
Here, Admins add projects to the tool and assign them to testers for testing.
Testers have individual logins to access the tool and view their assigned tasks.
Testers can perform test cases for the assigned projects and execute them.
This provides a status for each executed test case, allowing testers to see the results.
Admins have oversight to view the results and status of all executed test cases, along with a list of testcases executed.
The backend of the tool is by SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
